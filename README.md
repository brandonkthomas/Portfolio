# Portfolio

Personal portfolio site w/ interactive business card, project showcase, photo gallery & contact links

This code is currently hosted at [brandonthomas.net](https://brandonthomas.net).

**Stack:** ASP.NET Core MVC backend, vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (*+ Three.js*) frontend

> **Remarks:**  
> This project began as a simple Three.js card experiment and has since evolved into a more comprehensive personal portfolio. I plan to keep adding new features as I'm inspired.
